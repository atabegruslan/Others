# Misc notes

## Paradigms

- Declarative - what. Eg: React
- Imperative - how. Eg: jQuery

## Functional programming vs OOP

Functional programming uses immutable data to tell the program exactly what to do. Object-oriented programming tells the program how to achieve results through objects altering the program's state.

Functional: good when you have a fixed set of things, and as your code evolves, you primarily add new operations on existing things.

OOP: good when you have a fixed set of operations on things, and as your code evolves, you primarily add new things.
