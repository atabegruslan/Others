# Simple start

1/ Install node    

2/ Create new project

Either `npx create-expo-app` or `npx create-react-native-app`

Local Expo CLI has became preferred over the Global one: https://blog.expo.dev/the-new-expo-cli-f4250d8e3421   
So `npx create-expo-app xxx` became preferred over `expo init xxx`   

Eg: You can start a project like this:

`npx create-expo-app@latest projectName --template blank`

- A common problem and solution: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58675179/error-emfile-too-many-open-files-react-native-cli/62437140#62437140  

3/ Run

`npx create-expo-app` by default creates these scripts in `package.json`
```
"scripts": {
  "start": "expo start",
  "android": "expo start --android",
  "ios": "expo start --ios",
  "web": "expo start --web"
},
```

You can run using the `Expo Go` app from your phone, or with `development build`. The `Expo Go` option is simpler. So,    
download `Expo Go` to your phone,    
run `npm run start` or `yarn start` (A.K.A.: `npx expo start`)       
scan the QR code from within the Expo Go app.   

`npx expo start` vs `npx expo run`

`start` defaults to Expo Go.   
If you press `a` or `i` after that, it will run in any attached simulators or devices.   

`run` automatically runs prebuild under the hood.   
It does everything in one command, eg: `npx expo run:android`

# Development build

- Very good article: https://expo.dev/blog/expo-go-vs-development-builds 
- https://docs.expo.dev/guides/local-app-development/#local-app-compilation

Various commands
- https://docs.expo.dev/more/expo-cli/#launch-target
  - `npm install expo-dev-client` then `npx expo start` will run a development build
  - `npx expo start --dev-client` will run a development build too.
  - `npx expo start` will run with Expo Go.
  - `npx expo start --clear` will run with Expo Go, without cache.

  - https://stackoverflow.com/a/76301305
- `ios` & `android` folders
  - `npx expo prebuild` generates `ios` & `android` folders.   
  - `npx expo eject` used to do this, but is now obsolete.

## Bare vs Expo

Bare means without using Expo nor Metro bundler (nor any other frameworks) to manage it for you. You create the native app and configure everything yourself.

Back in the days, Expo wasn't fully stable and had some drawbacks in terms of using native Code and modules but today most projects can be run in Expo really well.

https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/prebuild is used to adapt from Expo to bare. But not fully bare.

You can create and run an Expo app on Expo Go on your phone and emulator. But when you start working with native stuff you'll need a dev build

## Local app compilation

To build your project locally you can use compile commands from Expo CLI which generates the android and ios directories:
`npx expo run:android`
`npx expo run:ios`
The above commands compile your project, using your locally installed Android SDK or Xcode, into a debug build of your app.

These compilation commands initially run npx expo prebuild to generate native directories (android and ios) before building, if they do not exist yet. If they already exist, this will be skipped.
You can also add the `--device` flag to select a device to run the app on â€” you can select a physically connected device or emulator/simulator.
You can pass in `--variant release` (Android) or `--configuration Release` (iOS) to build a production build of your app. Note that these builds are not signed and you cannot submit them to app stores. To sign your production build, see Local app production.

## Local builds with `expo-dev-client`

If you install expo-dev-client to your project, then a debug build of your project will include the expo-dev-client UI and tooling, and we call these development builds.

## `npx expo install expo-dev-client`
To create a development build, you can use local app compilation commands (`npx expo run:[android|ios]`) which will create a debug build and start the development server.

# Android Studio and xCode

It's advantageous to install `xCode` and `Android Studio` too.      
Typical system requirements:     
`xCode` needs ~50GB disk space, `Android Studio` needs ~20GB disk space. Overall, a Mac of ~200GB disk space.    
Android Emulator typically needs 16GB RAM & 16GB disk space. Though 8GB of RAM can still cope.

### Test publish - iOS

**Different ways:** https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-builds/upload-builds 

- `eas build --platform ios [--profile preview2]` and `eas submit -p ios --latest` with EAS (expo.dev): https://www.notjust.dev/blog/2022-03-29-how-to-publish-expo-react-native-app-to-apple-app-store
- Archive, and then upload with xCode: https://www.codecademy.com/article/ios-how-to-push-your-app-to-app-store-connect
- In CLI, build `.xacrhive` files (`eas build -p ios [--profile preview2] [--local]`), and then upload with xCode (xCode > organizer window > click upload to testflight): https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/distributing-your-app-for-beta-testing-and-releases
- `xcrun altool`: https://help.apple.com/asc/appsaltool
- Transporter app: Need to get it from Apple App Store 
  - Even though it's free, you still need an Apple ID associated with an payment method.
    - If you don't have an Apple ID associated with an payment method; Then ask someone with an Apple ID associated with an payment method, ask them to download it and send it to you as `.zip`, then you unzip it and drag it into the `Applications` folder. Then you'll be prompted to login with your Apple ID, here you can login with your own Apple ID.

If you encounter this issue below, you need to agree to Apple's latest contract (2024).

**Once you publish a build to App Store Connect's TestFlight:**

- Give info such as Privacy and Contact Info and Screenshots,
- Select a build (ie: version) from TestFlight,
- Submit for Review
- Invite Users and add Internal Testers

### Local builds

https://docs.expo.dev/build-reference/local-builds

### Update

`app.json`
```
    "ios": {
      "supportsTablet": true,
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.yyy.xxx",
      "buildNumber": "1",
      "config": {
        "usesNonExemptEncryption": false
      }
    },
    "android": {
      "package": "com.yyy.xxx",
      "versionCode": 1,
      "adaptiveIcon": {
        "foregroundImage": "./assets/adaptive-icon.png",
        "backgroundColor": "#ffffff"
      }
    },
```

### Update - Android

Increment `versionCode`!

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBWBDaqNuws&t=1635s

When testing: `Testing` > `Internal Testing` > `Create new release` & add testers

When creating anew: (Todo)

This step isn't necessary
- https://www.notjust.dev/blog/2022-04-11-how-to-publish-expo-react-native-app-to-google-play-store#creating-google-service-account
- https://www.notjust.dev/blog/2022-04-11-how-to-publish-expo-react-native-app-to-google-play-store#updating-application

If you do it (Linking service account and downloading the key), you can then publish new releases automatically by: `eas build --platform android` then `eas submit -p android --latest`, with `eas.json`:
```js
{
  ...
  "submit": {
    "production": {
      "android": {
        "serviceAccountKeyPath": "path to that downloaded key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If not, then just `eas build --platform android`, manually download build from expo.dev and upload to Google Play Console.

### Update - iOS

- Increment `buildNumber`! Version number can stay the same - esp for small changes, `eas build --platform=ios` then `eas submit -p ios --latest`
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LE4Mgkrf7Sk&t=1654s
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUVbpT-Vks&t=710s

### Versions

- ![](/Illustrations/Mobile/RN_Expo/versions_in_react_native.png)

Don't forget to update remote version too https://docs.expo.dev/build-reference/app-versions/#remote-version-source

So:   
`eas build:version:set` to set Android `versionCode` and iOS `buildNumber`, and chose remote. `eas.json` will be updated.   
`eas build:version:sync`   

And don't forget to update:
- `android/app/build.gradle`'s `versionCode` and `versionName`
  - `versionCode` corresponds to `app.json`'s Android `versionCode`
  - `versionName` corresponds to `app.json`'s `version`
- `ios/quizlingo/Info.plist`'s `CFBundleVersion` and `CFBundleShortVersionString`:
  - `CFBundleVersion` corresponds to `app.json`'s iOS `buildNumber`
  - `CFBundleShortVersionString` corresponds to `app.json`'s `version`

## iOS

**Pod**: In iOS, a pod is a third-party library or framework that is integrated into a project using CocoaPods (CocoaPods is a dependency manager)

To reinstall all CocoaPods afresh: `rm -rf node_modules; rm -rf ios/build; rm -rf ios/Pods; rm -rf ios/Podfile.lock; yarn; yarn podinstall`.   
Or just delete `ios/build` and `ios/Pods` folders, then run `npx expo run:ios` again.   
Or alternatively: `cd ios`, then `pod repo update`, then `pod install`.
