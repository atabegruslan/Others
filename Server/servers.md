# Nginx vs Apache

Apache - Process driven, can handle large number of requests/second. New process for each request. But slow if visit number increase.  
Nginx - Event driven, won't slow if visit number increase.  

Apache - More flexible: More addons, handle more scripting languages.  
Nginx - Better performance.
